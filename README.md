# General notes about these AHK scripts

> - 'PgUp' is used to start scripts

> - 'PgDown' is used to pause / start scripts

- When in doubt - restart the script entirely

- Refer to each individual script for how to set-up your character / location before starting

- Make sure your bank pin is already entered - all scripts assume access to bank is possible from start
